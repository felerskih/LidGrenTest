First start the Server.exe under "Server/bin/Debug/Server.exe". You should see a message that the Server is running. Then do the same for the client under "Client/bin/Debug/Client.exe". You should see a message on the Server that the client has connected. You can now type a message to send to the client followed by the Enter key. The server will acknowledge that it received the message and echo the response.
